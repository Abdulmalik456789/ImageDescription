Image Description JavaScript
This JavaScript code is designed to create a simple HTML page with an image and a floating text description positioned above the image. All the necessary code is contained within the index.js file.

Description
The script dynamically generates an HTML img element and appends it to the document body. It then creates a div element to hold the text description, positioning it above the image. The text description is customizable and can be adjusted according to the user's preferences.

Usage
Ensure that the index.js file is included in your project directory.
Replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' with the actual path to your desired image file.
Customize the text description by modifying the textContent property of the description element.
Adjust the positioning, styling, and other properties of the description element as needed to achieve the desired appearance.
Notes
The script utilizes absolute positioning to ensure that the text description floats above the image.
Styling properties such as background color, padding, font family, font size, and text color can be customized to match the design requirements.
Ensure that the z-index property of the description element is set appropriately to ensure it appears above the image.
